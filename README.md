The following is a sample of products created during the _"Data Visualization and Reproducible Research"_ course.


## Project 01

In the `project_01/` folder, you can find an analysis of rat sightings in New York City from 2015 - 2017

**Sample data visualization:**

## Project 02

In this project, I explored how American runners did in the 2017 Boston Marathon. Find the code and report in the `project_02/` folder.

### Moving Forward

_Please add here a short reflection on what you learned and what you plan to continue exploring in terms of data visualization, data storytelling, reproducible research, and/or related topics._

Throughout this course I was able to learn a lot about data visualization and reproducible research. At each project I was able to learn a lot and improve. My biggest takeaway from the first project was to make sure the x axis labels when it came to days of the week were in order. Project 2 was my favorite and I was able to learn so much about spatial visualizations and focusing on one subset to create a better story line to understand the data better. Project 3 was the most challenging. Trying to recreate the visualizations was hard because I had to look at all the small details to make sure it was right. In the future I will continue to incorporate all the lessons I learned on good story telling with data visualizations.
